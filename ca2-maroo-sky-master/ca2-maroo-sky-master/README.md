# Coding Assignment 2: Implementation of a neural network

## Introduction
The second coding assignment requires you to implement a neural network.
Here, you'll learn what happens when you simply type `loss.backward()`, for example, by implementing the functions without any neural network libraries.

## Deadline
December 19, 2020 11:59PM KST (*No delay is permitted*)

## Submission checklist
- Read `ca2.pdf` carefully and follow the insturctions
- Push your code to our github classroom page's CA2 section
- Submit your report to Gradescope 'CA2 Report' section


## Preparation

### Clone the repository
To start, download the files and code from the repository with `git clone [repository_address]`.
For example, run the following shell prompt (not in a python interpreter):
```
$ git clone https://github.com/gistvision/mldl_ca2.git
```

### Download dataset
Download the dataset from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12e7VzlPZQ6yql_w3I5iuAs7oO6OGeKI1/view?usp=sharing) and unzip in the folder of your code. `YOUR_CODE_FOLDER/data/` folder should have this data.

### Installing prerequisites
The prerequisites usually refer to the necessary libraries that your code can run with. They are also known as `dependency`. 
To install the prerequisites, run the following shell prompt (not in a python interpreter):
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## What to do
You'll find what to do in `ca2.pdf` in detail.

## Files you'll edit:
- `python/nn.py`
- `python/q1.py` for Q1
- `python/q2.py` for Q2
- `python/q3.py` for Q3

## Report
Please write your answers for 'Writeup' items in `ca2.pdf` in `report.pdf`.

### Note
**Academic dishonesty:** We will be checking your code against other submissions in the class for logical redundancy. If you copy someone else's code and submit it with minor changes, we will know. These cheat detectors are quite hard to fool, so please don't try. We trust you all to submit your own work only; please don't let us down. If you do, we will pursue the strongest consequences available to us.

**Getting help:** You are not alone! If you find yourself stuck on something, contact the course staff for help. Office hours, class time, and Piazza are there for your support; please use them. We want these projects to be rewarding and instructional, not frustrating and demoralizing. But, we don't know when or how to help unless you ask.
